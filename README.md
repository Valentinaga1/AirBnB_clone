## ðŸ“‚ Description of the project

>>This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integrationâ€¦

>>Each task is linked and will help you to:

>- put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances

> - create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel

> - create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.

> - create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
